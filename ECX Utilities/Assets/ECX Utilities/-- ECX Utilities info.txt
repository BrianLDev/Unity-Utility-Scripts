ECX UTILITY SCRIPTS
Last updated: Dec 26, 2023

A variety of Unity utility scripts that I've created over time.  Useful for almost any project to save time and focus on more important stuff.

The scripts are organized into separate folders so you can delete any folders if the related utility scripts aren't needed for your project.  For example, if your game project isn't using DOTS, simply delete the DOTS folder and keep the rest. (note that many scripts inherit from the Singleton script so avoid deleting that one unless necessary.)

Enjoy!
